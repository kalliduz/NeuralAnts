# Development Tasks

This document lists development tasks. Items marked as completed have
already been implemented in the codebase.

- [x] Implement genetic algorithm to evolve ant brains.
- [x] Visualize ant energy or life cycle.
- [x] Add pheromone trails for communication between ants.
- [x] Expand environment with obstacles or varied terrain.
- [x] Provide a simple neural network visualisation.
- [ ] Fade pheromone trails smoothly for better visuals.
- [ ] Create a central nest that ants can return to with food.
- [x] Remove dead ants from `Simulation.ants` once energy runs out.
- [x] Move pheromone decay logic to `Environment.updatePheromones()`.
- [ ] Draw a small energy bar above each ant for quick status feedback.
