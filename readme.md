# Neural Ants

A simple ant colony simulation that runs directly in the browser. Ants evolve
behaviours through small neural networks that mutate when food is plentiful.

## Usage

Open `main.html` in any modern browser. The page will display a canvas with a
population of ants seeking out food that appears over time. Before starting you
can set how many ants to spawn and tweak advanced parameters using the input
fields at the top of the page. A second canvas shows a visualisation of the
neural network used by the first ant. No server or build step is required.

## Repository Structure

- `main.html` – entry point that loads all scripts
- `css/` – style sheets
- `js/` – JavaScript source files
- `js/network_viz.js` – draws a small visualisation of the first ant's brain
- `docs/` – project documentation

See `docs/architecture.md` for a high level overview.

## Running Tests

The repository includes a suite of unit tests that exercise the core
JavaScript classes. Run them with Node's built-in test runner:

```bash
npm test
```
