# Neural Ants

A simple ant colony simulation that runs directly in the browser. The goal is
for ants to evolve behaviours through a small neural network. The current
version is a stub meant as a starting point for further development.

## Usage

Open `main.html` in any modern browser. The page will display a canvas with a
single ant moving randomly. No server or build step is required.

## Repository Structure

- `main.html` – entry point that loads all scripts
- `css/` – style sheets
- `js/` – JavaScript source files
- `docs/` – project documentation

See `docs/architecture.md` for a high level overview.
