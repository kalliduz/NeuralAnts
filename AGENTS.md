# Guidelines for Contributors

This repository is a simple browser-based experiment. When adding features or
fixes, please keep the following in mind:

- The simulation must remain runnable by simply opening `main.html` in a
  browser. Avoid build tools or frameworks that require a server.
- Update `docs/architecture.md` whenever the overall design or file structure
  changes.
- Keep examples minimal and lightweight so that the demo loads quickly.
- Update `readme.md` with any new usage instructions.
